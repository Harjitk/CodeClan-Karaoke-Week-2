# weekend-hw-week2

Using Ruby and TDD, I built a Karaoke Bar to check guests in and out of rooms and handle songs. 
I was able to achieve MVP by creating rooms, songs and guest. I was able to check guests in and out of the rooms and I added 
songs to the rooms. I also worked on extensions such as checking room availability when adding guests to a room and I added 
money as a property in order to check if guests have enough money to pay for the entry fee.
